# AGVis

**L**arge-scale **T**est**B**ed - **A**nother **G**rid **Vis**ualizer (short as LTB-AGVis or AGVis), visualization program for [CURENT](https://github.com/CURENT) [Large-scale Testbed](https://github.com/CURENT/ltb2), in the form of a web application.

# Why AGVis

AGVis is a geovisualization tool that facilitates the visualization of ***large-scale real-time*** power system simulation.

AGVis visualizing the entire North America system topology:
