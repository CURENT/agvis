What is AGVis?
--------------

**AGVis** (\ **A**\ nother **G**\ rid **Vis**\ ualizer) is a visualization program for CURENT's Large-scale Test Bed in the form of a web application. AGVis is capable of interfacing with two other CURENT projects, ANDES and DiME, to perform real-time visualizations of power systems. AGVis is currently in active development and a "lite" version that does not utilize ANDES to run simulations is currently in the works.

The source repository for AGVis can be found `here <https://github.com/CURENT/ltbvis>`_.
