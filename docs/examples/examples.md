# Examples

All examples on this page will use the same simulation run in the quick start guide.

## Custom Speed and Simulation Playback

Once a simulation has finished running, a playback bar will appear on the bottom left of the window.

Pressing the "**Stop**" button will reset the simulation back to the beginning. Pressing the "**Pause**" button will pause the simulation. Specific times in the simulation can be selected by manually moving the top slider.

The speed at which the simulation plays back can be adjusted as well by moving the bottom slider. A custom speed multiplier can be set by moving the slider all the way to the left.

## Searching

Clicking on the magnifying glass icon on the top left will open the search function.

Beginning to type in the name of a node from the simulation will bring up a list of the nodes most closely matching your input.

Clicking on one of the options will cause the window to find and zoom in on the chosen node. The window can be zoomed back out using the "**-**" button in the top left. The window can be zoomed in using the "**+**" button above the "**-**" button.

## Adjusting Configuration

Clicking on the cog icon in the sidebar on the right will open the configuration menu.

The configuration menu is for adjusting a wide variety of things like the hostname and the range of certain variables in the simulation. Configurations you have made can be saved using the "**Save config**" button and can be loaded in another instance with the "**Load config**"" button.

Changing the range of the angle, frequency, and voltage can have substantial effects on the simulation. Here is the simulation at 5.45 seconds with default settings.

Here is a new configuration for the simulation.

And here is the simulation at 5.45 with this change.

Needless to say, the change is quite drastic.
