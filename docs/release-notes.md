# AGVis Release Notes
AGVis uses a standard three digit (X.Y.Z) numbering system for versions. The first number indicates major releases of AGVis, like significant code rewrites and important new features. The second number is for minor releases, which are primarily just smaller features. The third number is for revisions--think bug fixes and small changes to UI.

## Upgrading
To upgrade AGVis, simply move to its directory and pull the most recent version from Git.

## Prior Versions (2022-08-19)
Before the release of 2.0.0, AGVis did not have a standardized numbering system for versions. On account of this and the fact that the primary developer for those pre-2.0.0 versions has moved on to other things, there is not a good way to label them. Feel free to consider the first version of AGVis that allowed for displaying nodes and simulation data the 1.0.0 version. The last 1.X.X version would then be the update that added in the Timestamp feature.
