AGVis is an open-source geovisualization tool for energy system.
Main features of AGVis include

  - a geographical visualization of power system simulation results
  - a MultiLayer feature that allows users to add multiple layers of data
    (e.g., gas network, communication network, etc.) to the map
  - an independent data reader that can visualize user-defined data

AGVis is currently under active development. To get involved,
