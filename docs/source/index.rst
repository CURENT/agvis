AGVis is a web-based open-source tool for geographical visualizations of energy systems.
AGVis is capable of real-time geographical visualization of power systems when coupled
with `ANDES`_ and `DiME`_.
AGVis is currently in active development and a standalone visualization of power systems
using user defined data is currently in the works.

AGVis is the visualization module for the CURENT Largescale Testbed (LTB). More information about
CURENT LTB can be found at the `LTB Repository`_.
