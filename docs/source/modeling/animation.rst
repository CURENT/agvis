Animations
========================
In AGVis, power system simulation results are visualized through animations, providing users with an
intuitive understanding of the system's behavior and performance.

Triangle plot
------------------------
The triangle plot animation is a visually appealing way to represent three-phase power systems. In this animation,
the three phases (A, B, and C) are represented by the vertices of an equilateral triangle. The magnitude and angle
of each phase are used to plot points within the triangle, with the center of the triangle representing a balanced
three-phase system.

As the simulation progresses, the triangle plot animation dynamically updates to reflect the changes in the power
system's phase magnitudes and angles. This provides users with an intuitive understanding of the system's state
and any imbalances or disturbances that may be occurring.

To implement the triangle plot animation in AGVis, JavaScript can be used to manipulate SVG (Scalable Vector
Graphics) elements, such as circles and lines, within the triangle. By updating the SVG elements' positions and
attributes in response to changes in the simulation data, the triangle plot animation can effectively visualize the
system's state over time. This interactive and dynamic visualization helps users better comprehend the behavior
of the power system and the impact of different scenarios on its stability and performance.
