Pre-v2.0.0 (2022-08-19)
==============================

Before the release of 2.0.0, AGVis did not have a standardized numbering system for versions.
On account of this and the fact that the primary developer for those pre-2.0.0 versions has moved on to other things,
there is not a good way to label them. Feel free to consider the first version of AGVis that allowed for displaying nodes
and simulation data the 1.0.0 version.
The last 1.X.X version would then be the update that added in the Timestamp feature.
